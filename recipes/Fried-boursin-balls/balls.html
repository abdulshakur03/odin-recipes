    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 quart canola oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>2 (4.23-oz) packages Boursin Garlic and Fine Herbs Cheese Bites</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a large Dutch oven. Heat oil over
        medium heat to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        While oil heats, set out 3 wide shallow bowls. Fill them individually
        with flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working with a handful of bites at a time, gently dredge cheese in
        flour, and shake off excess. Dip in eggs; let excess drip off. Dredge in
        breadcrumbs to coat. Place on a small rimmed baking sheet or large
        plate. Transfer to freezer for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry boursin bites in batches, cooking until golden, 30 seconds to 1
        minute. Set on paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining
        bites. Transfer to a platter and serve immediately.
